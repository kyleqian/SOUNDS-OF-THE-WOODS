# Sounds of the Woods

_Created by Angela He and Kyle Qian as a part of Stanford's MUSIC257 (Neuroplasticity and Musical Gaming)._

You're lost and injured in the woods, and it's quickly getting dark. All you have with you is a flashlight and a radio. You called for help on the radio, but it looks like it'll take until sunrise until help can arrive, so you'll have to survive the night. You see friendly woodland creatures as the sun sets, but as it gets darker, you start seeing and hearing other creatures lurking in the night...
